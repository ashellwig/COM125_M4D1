	abstract = {Listening is a vital part of people's daily lives. Listening is the only way they can properly learn new information or understand how to do things. Listening is done in a variety of situations and for a variety of reasons, many of which do not involve an overlapping skill set. When one listens to music, one is not involved in the same sort of activity as when one listens to a friend vent alter a difficult day of work or when one listens to one's employer give instructions on a new procedure. Listening is a popular subject among scholars of interpersonal communication for a number of reasons. The fact that interpersonal scholars are often teachers and that listening is understood as an important part of the students' lives undoubtedly plays a role in the reason for the popularity of the subject matter.},

@article{caspersz_can_nodate,
	title = {Can we teach effective listening? An exploratory study},
	abstract = {This paper describes an exploratory study that was conducted with Business School and School of Population Health undergraduates to assess whether we can teach effective listening. Effective listening is conscious listening when the listener hears both verbal and non verbal communication that is being transmitted by the sender. We developed an intervention using open space technology that was administered to both groups of students to explore our research focus. Drawing on our findings, we argue that effective listening can foster transformative learning. However, this requires educators to plan to manage the listening factors/filters that influence effective listening in the same way that they plan to teach content and generic skills to students. Our study provides some empirical understanding of the factors/filters that influence effective listening by students. The study also makes a theoretical and practical contribution to a gap in teaching and learning literature about listening.},
