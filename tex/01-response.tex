      In my search for different non-verbal communication in a different
        culture, I came across a custom of kissing as a greeting in Romania.
        The Romanians press their facial cheeks squarely against each other and
        then give each a sideways kiss.  One is to make contact with the outside
        corner of their lips to the other personâ€™s cheeks. Men generally do not
        kiss one another, but women generally use this type of kiss to greet
        their friends and family.  How much people kiss in this manner is a
        sign of how close of a relationship they have. I think if I kissed
        another man on both cheeks, especially if we have a friendly
        relationship, my husband would probably get extremely jealous.
        Furthermore, I have four brothers and cannot imagine my lips touching
        their cheeks. It just sounds repulsive.  A handshake or simple hug is
        so much more palatable.

      The Travel Channel could suggest that in Romania hugging is extremely
        rare. Do not be alarmed or offended if you end up in a greeting
        involving cheek kissing. Just go along with it and you may find it
        absolutely enjoyable.
