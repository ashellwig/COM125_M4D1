    \textbf{Overview}\\%
    Just like countries have different languages, our nonverbal communication
      may not equate to the same meaning. For example, the thumbs up gesture
      means ``good job'' in the United States. But in the Middle East, it’s
      the equivalent of an insult! That’s a significant difference in meaning
      that could lead to huge misunderstandings.\\%

    For this discussion, you will research nonverbal communication in another
      country's culture (outside of the United States) and compare and
      contrast nonverbal communication in the country you selected with your
      home country's culture.\\%

    As we saw in the movie clip appearing within the topic titled, ``The
      Theme'' and in the TED Talk titled, ``The Importance of Listening'', our
      body language often communicates messages in addition to our verbal
      communication. Reflect for a few moments on how your body language
      messages might be received by people from a different culture who do not
      understand the intended meaning of your nonverbal communication.\\%

    You should spend approximately 4 hours on this assignment.\\%

    \subsection*{Instructions}
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Be sure you have completed your readings and explored all the
          materials, including videos, in the Exploration page accessible
          within the ``Read/View'' topic of Module 4 Content.

        \item Research the culture of another country with which you are
          either familiar or unfamiliar.

        \item In your research, focus on nonverbal communication.
          Specifically, consider gestures, facial expressions, and proximity
          (i.e., how close people stand to each other). In addition, research
          whether nonverbal communication is different between genders in the
          culture you have selected.

        \item Include and answer the following questions in your main post:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item In your own words, define language and nonverbal
              communication. How is the nonverbal communication of the culture
              you researched different from nonverbal communication in your
              home country's culture? How is nonverbal communication similar
              or the same?

            \item What are the differences in nonverbal communication between
              genders in the culture you researched? If there are no
              differences, why do you feel nonverbal communication between
              genders is the same?

            \item What was the most surprising difference between your home
              country's culture and the country's culture you chose to from
              this Discussion assignment?

            \item Write a sidebar (3--4 sentences) that could be highlighted
              on the Travel Channel's website for readers traveling to the
              country you researched on how they should greet a stranger from
              the other culture. Include at least three tips. Consider
              questions such as, should they bow? Wave? Offer their hand to
              shake? Would they greet a man differently than a woman? How
              close should they stand? Should they smile?
          \end{itemize}
      \end{enumerate}
